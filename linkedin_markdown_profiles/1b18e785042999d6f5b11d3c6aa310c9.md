- Speech Recognition (SR) is the ability to translate a dictation or spoken word to text. Speech Recognition known as “automatic speech recognition“ (ASR),or speech to text(STT) • Speech recognition is the process of converting an acoustic signal, captured by a microphone or any peripherals , to a set of words . • To achieve speech understanding we can use linguistic processing • The recognized words can be an end in themselves, as for applications such as commands & control data entry and document preparation. In the society every one either human or animals wish to interact with each other and tries to convey own message to others . The receiver for messages may get the exact and full idea of the senders, or may get the partial idea or sometimes can not understand anything out of it. In some cases may happen when there is some lacking in communication (i.e when a child convey message, the mother can understand easily while others can not )
