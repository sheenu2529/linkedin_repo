- Carbon Footprint
- A carbon footprint is a measure of how much greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, are emitted by a person, an organization, a product, or a country in a given period of time. It can be used to compare the environmental impact of different activities, products, organizations, or countries on the climate. A carbon footprint can include both direct emissions, such as those from burning fossil fuels for transportation or heating, and indirect emissions, such as those from producing and consuming goods and services that require energy. A carbon footprint can be calculated using different methods and tools, depending on the scope and purpose of the analysis. Some examples of online tools that can estimate carbon footprints are [Carbon Footprint Calculator](^1^), [Ecological Footprint Calculator](^2^), and [Global Footprint Network](^3^).Source: Conversation with Bing, 2/9/2023(1) . https://bing.com/search?q=carbon+footprint+definition.(2) Carbon footprint | Definition, Examples, Calculation, Effects, & Facts .... https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-footprint.(3) Carbon footprint - Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint.(4) Carbon footprint Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon%20footprint.(5) undefined. http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/.
