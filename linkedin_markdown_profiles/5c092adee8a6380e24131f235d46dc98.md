- Celebrating 25 Years of Leadership: Paddy's Silver Jubilee at Infosys ðŸŽ‰

We had the honor of celebrating a truly remarkable milestoneâ€”our Delivery Manager, Padmanabhan, has completed 25 years of service at Infosys!

Throughout his journey, Paddy has always emphasized one key principle: "Put people first." This guiding philosophy has not only shaped his leadership style but has also fostered a culture of collaboration, trust, and mutual respect within our teams. Paddy's commitment to prioritizing people has been the cornerstone of countless successful projects and the development of many careers, including mine.

The silver jubilee celebration was more than just a recognition of his years at Infosys; it was a heartfelt acknowledgment of the profound impact he has made on all of us. Paddy's leadership, dedication, and unwavering support have been an inspiration to us all.

Thank you, Paddy, for always putting people first and for being the incredible leader that you are. Here's to the next chapter of your journey!
